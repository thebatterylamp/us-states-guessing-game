# us-states-guessing-game
This is another Turtle Graphics Package product. 
It allows a user to type in the names of US States and if the name is correct, the state name is printed on the USA MAP. 
Typing is case insensitive but spelling needs to be correct. 
If the user types 'quit', automatic plotting begins for the missed states. 
The user sees the score in the text input box title.
